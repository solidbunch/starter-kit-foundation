## Overview

StarterKit is a baseline WordPress environment template built for rapid project initiation.
It provides a preconfigured Docker-based infrastructure and a custom starter WordPress theme designed for modern development workflow. The kit simplifies the handling of sensitive data, and supports flexible configuration across multiple environments.

- Docker-based environment
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Server provisioning with Ansible
- CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
- Custom WordPress theme with FSE, SCSS, Composer and PSR-12
- Secure, scalable, and production-ready setup by default

StarterKit follows Infrastructure-as-Product principles:
you get local, staging, and production environments configured, provisioned, and deployed consistently across all stages.
